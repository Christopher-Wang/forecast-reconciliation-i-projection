# Approximate Discrete Probabilistic Forecast Reconciliation via Information Projections

This repository contains the code for **Approximate Discrete Probabilistic Forecast Reconciliation via Information Projections**.

The project introduces a novel method for reconciling probabilistic forecasts generated from regression-via-classification models in hierarchical time series. It works by projecting incoherent marginals onto the space of approximately coherent distributions.

The [TourismSmall Dataset](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/datasetsforecast/hierarchical.html#tourismsmall) and accompanying cross-validation predictions are provided as an example.
